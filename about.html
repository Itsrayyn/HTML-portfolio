  retail staff – Iceland
  I learnt a lot when I was working at Iceland as it being my first paid job, I did things from organising the shop floor which shows my attention to detail with the task to work under pressure making it look appealing and tidy to also working the tills and talking to many customers. Which helped me a lot with my communication skills with customers it also showed my ability to work under pressure and show integrity to work an important job at a young age.
